    <p>I’m Jill, I’m from Long Island but I’ve been living in upstate New York for the past few years. I have a bachelor’s in Anthropology and a minor in Native American Studies from SUNY Geneseo, then I went to SUNY Buffalo and SUNY Oswego to take classes related to healthcare before I settled on computer programming. I started playing string bass when I was nine and played through college, but I haven’t played since then and I miss it.  I’m an enthusiastic tea drinker. I played rugby for five years and I was a team captain for two while at Geneseo and it is my favorite sport. While not learning how to code, I like to hike, bike, lift weights, kayak, try to learn German and Italian, cook, and tear the people on House Hunters apart for being so unreasonable all the time. Some hobbies that I hope to get into in the next year are skiing and skeet-shooting. 
	Quirkier aspects of me: I make my own soap because I couldn’t find a cheap brand that was rough enough. I’ve noticed that my favorite character in movies and on TV is usually a rich, snobbish, completely out-of-touch older woman, preferably a boozehound as well. I’m talking about characters like Emily Gilmore, Karen Walker, Tammy Swanson (II), Elizabeth Benning, Lucille Bluth, Colleen Donaghy, and Malory Archer.
