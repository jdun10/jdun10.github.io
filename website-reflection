To create a repository on GitHub, you click on the plus sign next to your avatar in the top right corner and hit “create a 
new repository”. Then fill out the appropriate licensing and privacy settings. To clone it, copy the provided url in the box on 
the lower right section of the page and type in “git clone [the link]” to your terminal. Open Source means that your code can 
be viewed and used by anyone. I think that Open Source is a good thing as long as you aren’t doing anything innovative with 
your code. It makes me think of the adage “If you can do something well, never do it for free”. At the moment, Open Source
doesn’t make me nervous at all as I’m not doing anything that I would be worried about others copying without my knowledge. As 
time progresses and I learn how to code more complex programs, I might become more protective of what I write. Using licenses 
are important because they clearly define to whom code belongs and who can use it. If you want control of what you write, don’t
use Open Source. This challenge allowed me to work on my skills that have to do with pushing content from my own machine to
GitHub and navigating Git. My “aha” moment was when I had been struggling to push my sublime text to GitHub and then was told 
that I had been in the wrong repository. My resource for better understanding a topic was Emmanuel.
