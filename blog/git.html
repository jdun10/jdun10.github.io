      The benefits of version control are that they allow one person or several people to work on a project without interfering with one another’s work. You can also keep a master branch for the code that you know works and you want to keep. If working alone, you can make branches to try things out if you don’t know if they will work. GitHub can help keep track of these changes by letting other people know if you have changed anything, where the change occurred, and what you expect it will do. Git lets us know where the changes are. Using GitHub is helpful because it will store the master branch for you, and you can fork and clone other branches too.
