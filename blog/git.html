      The benefits of version control are that they allow one person or several people to work on a project without interfering with one another’s work. You can also keep a master branch for the code that you know works and you want to keep. If working alone, you can make branches to try things out if you don’t know if they will work. GitHub can help keep track of these changes by letting other people know if you have changed anything, where the change occurred, and what you expect it will do. Git lets us know where the changes are. Using GitHub is helpful because it will store the master branch for you, and you can fork and clone other branches too.

      A few simple things to remember about ids and classes are that ids are more specific than classes, and classes are broad. You can add multiple classes to the same element, but id is only supposed to be used once per site. It is good practice to use “id” when targeting a specific part of the site. You should keep the names simple and functional so that you can easily tell what it refers to.

      Arrays and hashes are both ways to store elements in your code rather than having to repeatedly write out the data. An array is more likely to be used with integers, but it's not unusual to find strings in them too. Hashes are like arrays in that they hold data, but unlike arrays, they also hold a corresponding value for each item. This first item is called an array and they are neatly paired together. Hashes are good for storing data such as a product and its price such as in a menu or for inventory purposes. Something that arrays can do but hashes cannot is be ordered with an index. An array item could be specified by saying "puts arr[0]", and the zeroth (aka the first item would be putsed.

      group_by is an enumerable method that returns a hash with the keys determined as a result of a block. You can have a block that contains some data as your input and group_by will return a hash where each key represents a group. The values of the keys will be the number of times that key occurred.
You can use it to group the final values of an equation once every part of the array has been iterated and group_by can be used to specify and track characteristics of the array’s data, such as string lengths or if they contain a certain character or substring.
It’s very useful for quick checks like frequency or string length.

<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
      I had never used article before, but I think I'll use it for my blog posts a lot
      to make it easier to separate if I want to do anything to them on their own in CSS.
    How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
      Elements get laid out on the page in the order that they are nested.
    What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more 
    handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
      I might make a snippet for the rest of my blog posts. I don't know what else I use
      often enough to make it worthwhile.
