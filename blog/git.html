      The benefits of version control are that they allow one person or several people to work on a project without interfering with one another’s work. You can also keep a master branch for the code that you know works and you want to keep. If working alone, you can make branches to try things out if you don’t know if they will work. GitHub can help keep track of these changes by letting other people know if you have changed anything, where the change occurred, and what you expect it will do. Git lets us know where the changes are. Using GitHub is helpful because it will store the master branch for you, and you can fork and clone other branches too.

      A few simple things to remember about ids and classes are that ids are more specific than classes, and classes are broad. You can add multiple classes to the same element, but id is only supposed to be used once per site. It is good practice to use “id” when targeting a specific part of the site. You should keep the names simple and functional so that you can easily tell what it refers to.

<!-- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
      I had never used article before, but I think I'll use it for my blog posts a lot
      to make it easier to separate if I want to do anything to them on their own in CSS.
    How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
      Elements get laid out on the page in the order that they are nested.
    What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more 
    handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
      I might make a snippet for the rest of my blog posts. I don't know what else I use
      often enough to make it worthwhile.
