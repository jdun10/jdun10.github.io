	<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
	      I don't know, I was by myself.
	    Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
	      I thought it was fun to think about how it would look one day, but then I realized that I was overcomplicating it for now.
	    What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
	      I thought that something that looked simple and organized on the page would be good.
	    What new semantic elements did you learn about?
	      I didn't learn anything new during this challenge.
